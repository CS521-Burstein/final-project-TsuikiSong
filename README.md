**Project Objectives**

The theme of our final project revolves around exploring wine quality. The project will involve two datasets with more than 1000 rows. They are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. We first visualized this data to understand further the different indicators and their relationship with the quality. After that, we use their attribute information to build a regression model to predict wine quality. Moreover, we create a classification model to understand further which of the two wines is of better quality. We also make a simple user interface to allow users to predict wine quality by entering various wine indicators. To understand our project in detail, compare its report with the code in the Jupyter notebook. This project will demonstrate the flexible use of Python packages such as SKlearn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Weiyao Xu will be responsible for visualizing all aspects of the dataset. Longyuan Tang will be responsible for building the regression model and creating a simple User Interface. Xiangxian Song will be responsible for creating a classification model. After that, we will complete the Wine Quality Analysis Report together.

**Below are details about our datasets.**

The two files "winequality-red.csv" and "winequality-white.csv" are the datasets we obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The two datasets are red wine preference samples and white wine preference samples. Wines are rated on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher numbers indicating better quality wines. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical and sensory variables are available. In short, both datasets will play a vital role in our project.

Each dataset contains the following 12 columns, which are:

1. fixed acidity

2. volatile acidity

3. citric acid

4. residual sugar

5. chlorides

6. free sulfur dioxide

7. total sulfur dioxide

8. density

9. pH

10. sulphates

11. alcohol

12. quality

    

The "winequality.names" is the description of attribute information.
